                    <h3>Liability for Contents</h3>
                    <p>As service providers, we are liable for own contents of these websites according to Sec. 7,
                        paragraph 1 German Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to Sec. 8 to 10 German Telemedia Act
                        (TMG), service providers are not obligated to permanently monitor submitted or stored
                        information or to search for evidences that indicate illegal activities.</p>
                    <p>Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use of information remain
                        unchallenged. In this case, liability is only possible at the time of knowledge about a
                        specific violation of law. Illegal contents will be removed immediately at the time we get
                        knowledge of them.</p>
                    <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
                    <p>Our offer includes links to external third party websites. We have no influence on the contents
                        of those websites, therefore we cannot guarantee for those contents. Providers or
                        administrators of linked websites are always responsible for their own contents.</p>
                    <p>The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of the
                        establishment of the link. Illegal contents were not detected at the time of the linking. A
                        permanent monitoring of the contents of linked websites cannot be imposed without reasonable
                        indications that there has been a violation of law. Illegal links will be removed immediately
                        at the time we get knowledge of them.</p>
